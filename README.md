# TF-IDF with idf adpapted for a single document corpus 

The goal of this program is to use TF-IDF ( Term Frequency - Inversed document frequency )   formulas but without a corpus of text to calculate the idf of "stop" words.
I try to have a representation of the 20 more relevant words, in the novel "Les misérables" from the french author Victor Hugo.
